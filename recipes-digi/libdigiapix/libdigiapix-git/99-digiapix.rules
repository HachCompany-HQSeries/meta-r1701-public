# libdigiapix: configure interfaces so they can be used by group 'digiapix'

#
# Use two different rules for GPIO's.
#
#   1. The first rule (gpiochip0) allows to configure the GROUP and MODE of
#      the 'export' and 'unexport' files. This is basically executed once on
#      boot and it's needed so a normal user (with group 'digiapix')
#      is able to export/unexport gpios.
#
#   2. The second rule configures the GROUP and MODE of the sysfs files that
#      are created whenever a 'gpio' is exported.
#
# This way we filter out multiple gpiochipX events that we don't want to attend
