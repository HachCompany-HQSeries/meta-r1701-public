# There are a number of modifiers that are allowed to be used in some
# of the different fields. They provide the following subsitutions:
#
# %n the "kernel number" of the device.
#    For example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'
# %e the smallest number for that name which does not matches an existing node
# %k the kernel name for the device
# %M the kernel major number for the device
# %m the kernel minor number for the device
# %b the bus id for the device
# %c the string returned by the PROGRAM
# %s{filename} the content of a sysfs attribute
# %% the '%' char itself

# NOTE - Even though we have LINUX partition auto mount disabled here, but during boot it will be mounted any how. It is
#        due to U-Boot has passed command line arguments with all these partition MTD part numbers and due to that UBIFS
#        drivers mounts them. Need to find the solution to disable them.
